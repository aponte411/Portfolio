# Portfolio

This repository contains some of my projects in Python and R. They vary in subject and scope - as my hobbies and interest do as well. My projects cover data acquisition, data cleaning, data exploration, data visuzalition, statistical analysis, and machine learning. If you have any questions or feedback about any of my projects (data sources, inspiration, critiques) feel free to contact me at aponted511@gmail.com.
